FlipCheckBox
====

### Description

Give your collections (on any `View` at all) a fancier look by adding a cool way to check elements. If your list can multi-select elements, you can add this component as a "status indicator". This is basically a customizable view flipper, with a "_front_" and "_rear_" faces, and an "accept" image in the "_rear_" that will animate changes in its state, mostly like the [GMail][1] app.

### Usage

The component will remain decoupled from any other `View` at all time, needing only an Activity context in order to work properly (for inflation purposes basically). You can inflate this component, as well as apply attributes, from `xml` or programmatically.
<br/>
```xml
<com.franlopez.flipcheckbox.FlipCheckBox
  android:id="@+id/flipCard"
  android:layout_width="wrap_content"
  android:layout_height="wrap_content" />
```
<br/>
Currently supported attributes are:

* `checked`: Set the starting state as "checked" or "not checked".
* `showAnimations`: Set whether or not to show animation upon state changes.
* `inAnimation`: Animation resource to apply when changing from "not checked" to "checked" state.
* `outAnimation`: Animation resource to apply when changing from "checked" to "not checked" state.
* `flipAnimationDuration`: How much time should the flip animation take.
* `frontLayout`: Layout to inflate on the "_front_" view ("not checked" state).
* `rearColor`: Color to apply on the "_rear_" view ("checked" state).
* `rearAcceptImage`: Representative image from the "checked" state.
* `showAcceptImage`: Whether or not the "accept" image should be shown.

The component also presents an interface (`OnFlipCheckedChangeListener`) which will receive events when the state change. Please, keep in mind that the library methods `setChecked(boolean)` and `switchChecked()` will fire an event when called, while `setCheckedInmediate(boolean)` **will not**.
